  ### No Coins Make 0 Change Test Case

  This test case verifies the functionality of the change-making algorithm with a scenario where **no coins make 0 change**. 

  - **Input**: A list of coins `[1, 5, 10, 21, 25]` and a target amount of `0`. 
  - **Expected Output**: An empty array, as no coins are needed to make 0 change. 

  The assertions in this test ensure that:

  - The API response status is `200`
  - The `Content-Type` header is `application/json`
  - The response body is a valid JSON
  - The 'fewestCoins' array in the response body is defined and has a length of `0`.
