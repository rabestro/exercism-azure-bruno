  ### A Greedy Approach is Not Optimal Test Case

  This test case verifies the functionality of the change-making algorithm with a scenario where **a greedy approach is not optimal**.

  - **Input**: A list of coins `[1, 10, 11]` and a target amount of `20`.
  - **Expected Output**: An array containing two coins of value `10`, which is the fewest number of coins that sum up to the target amount.

  The assertions in this test ensure that:

  - The API response status is `200`
  - The `Content-Type` header is `application/json`
  - The response body is a valid JSON
  - The 'fewestCoins' array in the response body is defined, has a length of `2`, and contains the coin of value `10`.
